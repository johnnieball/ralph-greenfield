# ralph-greenfield

Scaffold for autonomous greenfield TypeScript projects using the Ralph loop pattern.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axiiom/ralph-greenfield.git my-project
cd my-project
./setup.sh my-project
```

Then write your PRD and run the loop:

```bash
# Edit plans/prd.json with your user stories, then:
./plans/ralph.sh 20
```

## PRD format

Each user story needs: `id`, `title`, `description`, `acceptanceCriteria` (array), `priority` (int), `passes` (boolean, starts false), `notes` (string).

Stories must be small enough to complete in ONE iteration. Order by dependency. Include "Typecheck passes" and "Tests pass" in acceptance criteria.

```json
{
  "id": "US-001",
  "title": "Add priority field to database",
  "description": "As a developer, I need to store task priority so it persists across sessions.",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Add priority column to tasks table: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' (default 'medium')",
    "Typecheck passes",
    "Tests pass"
  ],
  "priority": 1,
  "passes": false,
  "notes": ""
}
```

For complex projects, consider using [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) to generate structured specs, then convert to the prd.json format.

## What's inside

- `plans/ralph.sh` — The loop. Fresh context per iteration, circuit breaker, rate limiting, dual exit detection.
- `plans/prompt.md` — The iteration prompt. 10-phase TDD workflow with verification gates.
- `skills/tdd/` — TDD methodology (Matt Pocock + obra/superpowers). Non-negotiable.
- `.claude/hooks/` — Git guardrails blocking dangerous commands.
- `.ralphrc` — Loop configuration (rate limits, circuit breaker thresholds).
