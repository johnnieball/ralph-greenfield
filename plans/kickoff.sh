analysis_prompt="You are a senior technical reviewer auditing a PRD before it is handed to an autonomous TDD agent (Ralph). The agent works one story at a time, writes a failing test first, then implements to make it pass. It has no human in the loop during execution.

Review the following PRD and check for:
1. **Oversized stories** — more than 5 acceptance criteria, or vague scope that could expand
2. **Missing infrastructure stories** — e.g. project setup, CI config, database schema that other stories depend on
3. **Implicit dependencies** — stories that must be done in a specific order but don't say so
4. **Ambiguous acceptance criteria** — criteria that can't be turned into a deterministic test assertion
5. **Architecture decisions that should be human choices** — e.g. which database, which auth provider, which UI framework
6. **Spike/research stories that can't be TDD'd** — exploratory work with no clear pass/fail

The agent uses strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD (see skills/tdd/SKILL.md). Every story must be expressible as: write failing test → implement → pass.

Format your response as:

## PRD Analysis: [project name]

### Issues Found
(numbered list, or \"None\" if clean)

For each issue:
- **Story**: [story ID]
- **Problem**: [what's wrong]
- **Suggestion**: [how to fix]

### Summary
- Stories: [count]
- Issues: [count]
- **VERDICT: READY** or **VERDICT: NEEDS_CHANGES**
