# Architecture - PROJECT_NAME

## Modules

<!-- Generated from PRD at kickoff. List each source module and its single responsibility. -->
<!-- Format: `src/module.ts` - One sentence describing what this module owns. -->
<!-- Example: `src/schema.ts` - Owns all Zod schemas and parse functions. No I/O, no rendering. -->

## Dependency Rules

<!-- Generated from PRD at kickoff. State which modules can import from which. -->
<!-- Format: "X can import from Y. X must never import from Z." -->
<!-- Keep to the critical boundaries only - don't list every valid import. -->

## Hard Constraints

<!-- 3-5 inviolable rules. No rationale, just the rule. -->
<!-- Example: "All file I/O is isolated in loader and builder modules. Renderer and schema modules must be pure." -->
<!-- Example: "Content types use Zod discriminated unions. Do not use type assertions to narrow." -->
